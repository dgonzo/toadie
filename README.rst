Toadie is a microservices framework that includes everything needed to create microservices and run on a compute cluster using the ambassador pattern. Compute cluster can be Elastic Container Service, Kubernetes, or similar. Toadie supports the concepts of `service` and `task`.

    * Service: Long-running application or worker
    * Task: Short-running application or worker, which often requires additional compute resorces be added to cluster

Toadie is designed with analytic processes and smaller teams in mind.

Toadie is inspired by django and rails and gummi bears.
